# dotfile config
#
# This file is used to express different profiles and how to install them.
# It starts with a unique profile name like "workstation".
# Nested underneath a profile is 4 sections: files, packages, shell, scripts
#
# files section
# The files section defines the different files and folders to symlink.
# The system will automatically determine if a file or folder is being linked.
# For private files, :private can be added to the end of them (like .ssh/id_rsa:private)
# which will then result in Bitwarden being used to secure store them outside of the repository.
# You can use .gitignore to hide files in symlinked folders, and this can be paired with :private too.
#
# packages section
# This section lists packages to install with the default package manager.
# Ubuntu will use apt with sudo, Alpine will use apk, and Termux will use pkg.
#
# shell directive
# This section simple defines the user preferred shell like fish or bash.
# If fish, you do not need to define it in packages as it will be auto-installed.
#
# scripts section
# Similar to files this consists of named sub-sections with a list of shell scripts to run.
# Ideally this should not be needed as packages and shell sections should handle most things.
